## Reconstitution experiments


### Generate sequences from 5fC-sites flanking regions

TODO --> how did we generate `TDG_KO.Hindbrain.cns4.unique.end.fasta` and the rest? 

### Computational prediction of nucleosome occupancy

The code used, along with its usage instructions, is described [here](Comp_prediction_nucleosome_occupancy/README.md)
