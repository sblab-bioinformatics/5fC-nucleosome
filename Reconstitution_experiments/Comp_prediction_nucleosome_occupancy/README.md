## Computational prediction of nucleosome occupancy

Use van Noortâ€™s sequence-dependent nucleosome occupancy predictor to reproduce the observed in-vitro results.
We have analysed the probability to form nucleosomes in two regions: 200 base pairs around the 5fC site center location, and 200 base pairs flanking the center. 

The code used for the calculation can be found [here](nuc_occ_van_noort/README.md)

The final figure was prepared using `xmgrace`, I leave [here](xmgrace_file_figure/show_occ_vannoort_regions.agr) the `.agr` file (the format in which `xmgrace` saves its files).
