## Enhancers-DE in 5fC-related nucleosomes Heart vs brain

This section requires the results from these analysis,

-   [Differential gene expression](../RNA-seq/README.md)
-   [Nucleosome positioning](../MNase-seq/README.md)
-   [5fC data](../5fC_sites_in_heart_brain_WT_and_TDG_KO)

## Differential expression KO vs WT in each tissue

We have processed the data using [this](scripts/WT_vs_TDG_KO_DE_in_heart_and_brain.ipynb) notebook.

## Differential expression between heart/hindbrain tissues, in WT and TDG-KO

We have processed the data using [this](scripts/brain_vs_heart_DE_via_RenLab_enhancers.ipynb) notebook.
