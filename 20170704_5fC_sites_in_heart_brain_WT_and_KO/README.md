# Obtain 5fC sites in heart and hindbrain, both for WT and TDG-KO

Prepare a set of `bed` files containing the genomic regions for 5fC in 
heart and hindbrain, both for WT and for TDG-KO.

Create sets of 5fC sites that are a consensus between replicates, as well as 
common or unique between tissues/conditions.
