## Manuscript: 5-Formylcytosine is a determinant of nucleosomal organization

This repository contains a description of the computational methods associated to the manuscript (include link).

Details about the "fundamental" analyses are given in the following sections:

-   [5fC pull down](5fC_pull_down/README.md)
-   [MNase-seq](MNase-seq/README.md)
-   [RNA-seq](RNA-seq/README.md)
-   [Reconstitution experiments](Reconstitution_experiments/README.md)
-   [Histone mark datasets used](Histone_marks_datasets/README.md)
-   [Polymerase stop assays](Polymerase_stop_assays/README.md)
-   [Computational prediction of nucleosome occupancy]

The following analysis are derived from data generated in the sections above:

-   [5fC sites in heart/brain for WT and TDG-KO](5fC_sites_in_heart_brain_WT_and_TDG_KO/README.md)
-   [5fC-related gene expression in mouse embrio heart and brain (figures 3 and 4 in the manuscript)](5fC_related_expression_in_heart_and_brain/README.md)
